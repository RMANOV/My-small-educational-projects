resetting the sudo password is a bit tricky, but it can be done. here is how you can do it:

2. select the option to enter the recovery mode.
3. wait for the system to boot up.
4. select the option to drop to a root shell.
5. type the following command: `passwd root`
6. you will be prompted to enter the new password.
7. type the new password twice.
